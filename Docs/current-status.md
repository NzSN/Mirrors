# Current framework status and navigation

Documentation synchronized 2026-10-07. Source-navigation heads: Mirrors `6422451`,
MirrorECMA `720dfda`, MirrorCPP `530304e`, MirrorRust `08d189f`, MirrorGate `455e196` and
MirrorLean `b161cbe`. These heads identify the inspected source, not new qualification.

## Qualified scope and evidence

The [published roadmap candidate](../Plans/q3-published-roadmap-2026-10-07.md)
qualifies for `m5-wsl-windows-remote/v1`, qualification class `local-candidate`,
at Mirrors `f0894d2`, MirrorECMA `eef6f71` and MirrorGate `455e196` under C0
`94271a543085118e47c7fd540ee8d34d3f427fa5f45fedaeba0c852534f4f34a`.
All 18 required commands/16 tiers, both installed D bindings, 19 scope nodes,
20 independently verified bundles and six rejected controls pass. Source-hidden
installed replay, real mismatch/mutation, both R1 branches, prefix/domain
reduction, prepared-filesystem recovery and the remote model/client matrix are
bound to that record. Subsequent documentation/catalog publication does not
extend it to a new implementation or release automatically.

M6 reviewed scaffolds/corpora, compiler/client follow-ups and the read-only
[lock migration helper](model-interface-compiler/lock-migration.md) are implemented.
[DPM](deterministic-scheduling.md) is accepted through DPM-5 for declared C++,
Node-worker and Rust-thread profiles. Its finite/native/package evidence remains
separate from the framework's independently pinned compatibility matrix.

The latest qualified topology uses WSL2 clients, local supplied-trace replay and
Linux/Bubblewrap Gate; live model operations use an owned native Windows mTLS
Mirrors service with Apalache 0.62.2 / Java 25.0.4+7-LTS. The service was started and
observed as PID 35888 during that campaign; reobserve before use. Its original
certificates were recorded as valid through 2026-10-08T02:47:53Z. Neither static documentation nor an
old PID/certificate record establishes current health or permission to re-pin.
No local Apalache/TLC runs on this coordinator.

## Approved usability features after the frozen candidate

The [generated DPM kit and counterexample timeline](dpm-usability-design.md)
are implemented and source accepted as the first approved slice. Their compiler/
tooling changes are newer than the frozen M5 candidate above; no new installed
package or full current-source qualification is inferred. The approved follow-on
schedule reducer, installed CLI and synchronization-wrapper profile remain queued
with explicit exit gates in [the feature plan](../Plans/dpm-usability-features-2026-10-07.md).

## Separate work and open choices

- Broader M4: aggregate cgroup enforcement and active-process post-restart
  recovery stay on a separate track, as explicitly requested by the user. See
  [native-host/process ownership plan](../Plans/m4-native-host-and-platform-plan-2026-10-07.md).
- Native Ubuntu acceptance, Windows/macOS Gate backends, service-manager
  AUTO_START acceptance and the legacy full all-transport matrix remain separate.
- DPM does not supply arbitrary instruction preemption, browser or async-Rust
  scheduling, weak-memory completeness, POR or generic native trap instrumentation.
  Non-intrusive scheduling is optional research, not an approved implemented profile.
- Package-registry publication, hosted CI and production deployment are not
  inferred from source commits or the named local-candidate qualification.
- [Haskell cutover](cutover.md) retains the stdio async error-tag decision and
  its documented deprecation/soak criteria. The multi-client runner is implemented.

Dated baselines, proof statements, frozen fixtures and machine-readable acceptance
files retain their original bytes/counts. A historical “pending” stage is not a
current blocker when a later record explicitly supersedes it. Generated catalog A
shows its own declarations and unknown observations; later approval B carries the
actual scoped observations. Documentation sync never fabricates either record.
